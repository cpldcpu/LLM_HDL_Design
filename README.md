# LLM_HDL_Design
Some hardware design experiments using large language models

This repo is mostly interesting for its history. I tracked
the ability of LLMs to generate a simple CPU core in Verilog
starting in early 2023. Once Sonnet 3.5 was released in 
June 2024, it was able to one-shot everything so that it
did not make sense to continue and further.
